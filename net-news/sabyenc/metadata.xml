<longdescription lang="en">
	Modified the original yenc module for use within SABnzbd.

	The module was extended to do header parsing and full yEnc decoding from 
	a Python list of chunks, the way in which data is retrieved from usenet.
	This is particularly beneficial when SSL is enabled, which limits the size
	of each chunk to 16K. Parsing these	chunks in python is much more costly.
	Additionally, this module releases Python's GIL	during decoding, greatly
	increasing performance of the overall download process.
